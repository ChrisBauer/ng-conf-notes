##### Problems solved by Universal Patterns
- Gap Events
- Asnyc execution
- Dependencies

##### Gap Events
Record user events while the UI is loading, then replay those events so that clicks and other interactions aren't forgotten

##### Async
Handle asynchronous data calls on the server and propagate their resolution to the UI

##### Dependencies
- what happens when you try to use client things like local storage on server side rendering?
- swap implementation using DI to be different based on platform (server or client)
