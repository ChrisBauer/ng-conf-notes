1.3 million 1.x users (200,000 started using Angular 1.x over past 6 months)

360k using Angular 2 already

#### Angular 2 supports:
- lazy loading
- decorators
- zones
- Server side rendering

##### Material Design for Angular 2
- Launching Mobile Tookit: [mobile.angular.io](http://mobile.angular.io)

##### Angular 2 Features
- Angular Universal: server side Angular and rendering
    - available for Node and ASP.NET. Java planned.
- Angular CLI
- Working on Augury, a chrome plugin to debug and monitor Angular apps
- Official Styleguide

##### Features to be backported to 1.x
- animation
- localization
- component router (minus lazy-loading?)


##### Angular 2 Benefits:
- Renders 5x faster than 1.x
    - Has a template compiler to pre-compile templates
- Angular 2 smaller than Angular 1.x file size
- Router can handle lazyloading

We should do more open source
