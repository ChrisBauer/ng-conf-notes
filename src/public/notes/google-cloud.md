This seminar was an active experience where attendees built, deployed and debugged a cloud application.

The tutorial can be found [here](https://gcplab.me/codelabs/cloud-cardboard-viewer)
Note that there may be some small charges to your account if you deploy the app.

The Cloud Shell is a virtualized Linux VM which can be used for developing, debugging and deploying applications on the cloud. The Cloud Shell is not required as all operations can be performed locally; but the shell provides a nice experience when local tools (such as the Cloud SDK, node and the cloud client) are not present. Note that only your home directory is persisted in the Cloud Shell.

I encourage you to follow through the walk-through as it is instructive and showcases some of the features of the cloud suite. Of particular note is:
- The ability to run a preview version of an application
- The ability to debug preview versions of an application, on the cloud
- Deploying multiple, concurrent versions of the application
- Debugging multiple, concurrent versions of the application
