Basics:

    <div @myAnimation="expression">
    ...
    </div>

Performance:

 - No getComputedStyle
 - Web Animations integration
 - can use Web-Animations Polyfill

**Height auto problem is solved!!  Animating dynamic height**

Lots of integration between components, animations and promises.

`animate()` can be used for NativeScript to create agnostic animation definitions
